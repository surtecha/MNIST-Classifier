The project uses **_K-Nearest Neighbors_** algorithm to classify hand written digits based on their similarity. The algorithm typically uses **_Euclidean Distance_** as a classification metric.

This project is made to classify hand written digits, obtained from the **_MNIST_** database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database). Each digits is stored as 28x28 pixel grayscale image. Using optimal fitting techniques, the accuracy can be achieved upto to **95%**.
